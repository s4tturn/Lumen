  Animation, morphing, and shader best practices for Liquid Glass and SwiftUI motion on
  iOS 26+/macOS 26+ through iOS 27. Use when animating glass or building UI motion:
  glassEffectID, @Namespace morphing, GlassEffectContainer spacing, glassEffectUnion,
  glassEffectTransition (.matchedGeometry/.materialize), withAnimation, springs, UnitCurve,
  PhaseAnimator, KeyframeAnimator, @Animatable, matchedTransitionSource, navigationTransition
  zoom, scrollTransition, visualEffect, Metal shaders (colorEffect, distortionEffect,
  layerEffect, [[stitchable]]), accessibilityReduceMotion gating, Instruments/xctrace
  profiling of hangs and animation hitches. Also fires on symptoms: glass morph not
  animating, view pops in instead of morphing, glass fades instead of materializing, morph
  flickers with Reduce Motion, menu glass morphs as a rectangle, animation runs on insert
  but not removal, PhaseAnimator loops forever or fires once, shader shows clipped edges
  (maxSampleOffset), animation hitches or main-thread hangs while scrolling glass chrome.
  For static glass, availability gating, toolbars, UIKit/AppKit glass, or accessibility of
  the material itself use the liquid-glass skill first.

# Liquid Glass — motion, animation, and shaders

Companion to the **liquid-glass** skill (`~/.claude/skills/liquid-glass/`). Same tag system:
`[verified]` / `[apple]` / `[multi]` / `[single]` / `[version-pinned]` — see that skill's
SKILL.md. Composed 2026-08 and verified against Apple documentation and SDK interfaces.

## Operating rules

1. Before generating code, ALWAYS read the availability firewall in the companion
   **liquid-glass** skill (installed alongside this one):
   `references/availability-and-sdk27.md`. Motion code trips the same SDK-27 breakages
   (`.if` ban, `@ContentBuilder`, renames).
2. Load references on demand via the router — one topic, one file.
3. The motion model: Liquid Glass and its motion were designed together. Glass does not
   fade — it materializes by modulating lensing; when glass grows, its material gets
   thicker (deeper shadow, stronger lensing). Size change is a material change, which is
   why morphs must be the system animation, never hand-faked.
4. Verify motion claims against `references/` before repeating them — circulating write-ups
   get several of these facts wrong; the corrected facts live in these files.
5. Profiling evidence beats reasoning: record an Instruments trace with `xctrace` before
   optimizing, and never trust the iOS Simulator for the SwiftUI instrument — see
   `references/performance-and-instrumentation.md`.

## Hard rules (the short list)

1. Never animate glass with `.opacity` / fades — use `glassEffectTransition`
   (`.materialize` is the sanctioned fade-like option). [multi]
2. Morphing silently no-ops unless ALL four hold: same `GlassEffectContainer`;
   `glassEffectID` per element in one shared `@Namespace`; the change is view
   insertion/removal (not a value change); the state change is inside `withAnimation`.
   Plus geometry: nearest edges within the container's `spacing`. [multi]
3. The interactive "squish" is one boolean — `.interactive()`. No public spring/damping/
   stiffness knobs exist; do not promise tunable jelly. [multi]
4. Gate every glass animation on `accessibilityReduceMotion` — the default morph is a
   kinetic effect, and reduce-motion users have experienced it as flickering. The system
   does NOT gate your `withAnimation` for you. [multi]
5. One animation source per property — never mix implicit `.animation`, `withAnimation`,
   and scroll-driven updates on the same property. Implicit later in the view tree silently
   wins over explicit. [multi]
6. The animation context must live OUTSIDE a conditional — an `.animation()` inside the
   `if` is destroyed with the view and removal never animates. [multi]
7. Prefer renderer-side motion for scroll: `scrollTransition` / `visualEffect(in:)` over
   observable scroll-offset plumbing. [apple]
8. Animate transforms first (scale/offset/rotation), frames second, identity changes last.
   [multi]

## Scripts

`scripts/record_trace.py` and `scripts/analyze_trace.py` (+ `instruments_parser/`) — vendored
from Antoine van der Lee's SwiftUI-Agent-Skill (MIT; licence ships beside them as
`scripts/LICENSE-AvdLee-SwiftUI-Agent-Skill`). Record and parse Instruments traces (Time
Profiler, Hangs, Animation Hitches, SwiftUI lanes) into JSON/markdown. Usage and interpretation:
